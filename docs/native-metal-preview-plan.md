# Native Metal Preview + GPU Compositor — Integration Plan (Phases 2 & 3)

This is the remaining native integration for the OBS Quality Root Fix. The GPU
compositor **core** is implemented and tested on-device (`metal_compositor.rs`:
device → render pipeline → textured-quad composite → readback, verified on Apple M4).
What's left is wiring it into the live paths and replacing the PNG-polling preview —
work that produces on-screen pixels and therefore needs **on-device visual validation**
(a human comparing against OBS), which no headless test can stand in for.

The honest gates from the earlier phases hold this work accountable: until the native
path lands, the preview-path badge reads **Fallback** and the transport-honesty gate
fails a "native" claim — by design.

## Current state (landed)

- `metal_compositor::composite_sources()` / `MetalSceneCompositor` — GPU composite of
  `GpuSource` layers (BGRA → texture → transformed quad → offscreen BGRA target), readback-
  tested. `MetalSceneCompositor` persists the device/queue/pipeline/sampler and reuses the
  same-size target texture and per-source textures across frames; it is `Send`.
- `bgra_to_yuv420p()` — full-range BT.601 conversion byte-compatible with the CPU
  compositor, so GPU frames drop straight into the existing encoder pipeline. CPU and
  Metal readback now share one conversion helper, keeping future OBS/HD colorimetry
  changes localized instead of split across preview and recording paths.
- **The GPU compositor is wired into the live compositor loop** and is default-on on macOS
  unless `VIDEORC_METAL_COMPOSITOR=0|false|off|no`: it composites Screen/Window/Camera scenes with
  transform crop, cover/contain fitting, camera mirror, circle masks, and cached screen
  images, and falls back to the exact CPU compositor for test patterns or uncached image
  sources, so enabling it never changes a frame it cannot reproduce.
- Recording startup now waits for consecutive target-resolution compositor frames that
  include every visible non-test source required by the scene, preventing a screen-only or
  camera-only early frame from satisfying a screen+camera recording barrier. The encoder
  bridge also has a regression guard that its first tick consumes an already-ready
  compositor frame as fresh target-resolution input instead of synthetic startup filler,
  and the live bridge now waits briefly for a newer compositor sequence before admitting a
  repeat so startup and late-run duplicate bursts stay inside the final-file gate.
- The Electron proof surface now coalesces compositor-status IPC updates while a paint is
  in flight, and the renderer feeds it through a latest-frame slot, so stale preview
  frames are dropped before they reach the proof window or backend present metrics.
- Preview present diagnostics now carry source-to-present p50/p95/p99 latency and the
  latest presented compositor frame lag, and the acceptance gate fails native previews
  above the OBS-parity latency/currentness budget.
- Fallback/proof PNG source snapshots now keep their low default caps but accept bounded
  `maxWidth` requests; the Electron proof surface requests layer-sized snapshots to
  reduce avoidable blur while the real CAMetalLayer host is still pending. Camera and
  screen PNG downscalers now use filtered sampling instead of nearest-neighbor picks,
  reducing jagged text and hard edges in the proof path.
- The backend now has an AppKit-backed native preview host foundation that can attach a
  `CAMetalLayer` to an `NSView` inside a transparent, mouse-ignoring borderless
  `NSWindow`; renderer bounds now include screen height so the host can convert Electron
  top-left coordinates to AppKit bottom-left frames. The remaining native-host work is
  command lifecycle, frame presentation, and on-device validation.
- The renderer now merges backend preview-surface status with the actual host status so a
  future live `CAMetalLayer` host can report `native-surface` / `cametal-layer` without
  being overwritten by the backend's Electron proof-surface startup status.
- Rust preview-surface create/update/destroy now records native-host lifecycle intent through
  a dedicated host seam and returns typed host command payloads with AppKit-converted
  bounds. The seam returns no activation yet, so the app still reports the Electron proof
  backing until the main-thread presenter runner presents real pixels.
- Preview-surface runtime now preserves those native-host commands in a drainable FIFO, so
  the future main-thread presenter loop can apply create/update/destroy in order instead
  of losing the command emitted during the backend request.
- A `NativePreviewPresenterRunner` now owns the AppKit overlay and a same-device Metal
  presenter on the main thread. It can apply host create/update/destroy commands and only
  returns native `CAMetalLayer` activation after `present_latest()` succeeds against the
  compositor target.
- `MetalSceneCompositor` can now hand its latest cached target texture directly to the
  preview presenter, so the native runtime can present the compositor output without first
  exposing raw Metal texture types across modules or reading pixels back for preview.
- While a preview surface is live, the compositor now emits lightweight per-frame progress
  status for the presenter path instead of making proof/native surface presents wait for
  the two-second diagnostics window.
- `make_preview_layer()` / `MetalPreviewPresenter` / `present_texture_to_layer()` — the
  GPU-side preview present (CAMetalLayer + render-scaled texture present), compile-and-run
  tested headlessly.
- The `CVMetalTextureCache` import test now creates an IOSurface-backed BGRA
  `CVPixelBuffer` and verifies that the zero-copy source import path can produce a real
  `MTLTexture` on-device.
- The native-preview recording smoke now gates the produced MP4 with the startup-resolution
  and final-file analyzers, plus a duration check, so transient VideoToolbox progress
  telemetry does not mask the decoded artifact. On 2026-06-06,
  `pnpm smoke:recording-native-preview` passed at 1080p30 with a 15.07s file, startup and
  final max repeated-frame run 2, preview 120.16fps, p95 interval 9.2ms, and 18ms A/V skew.
- Scene/transform math in `scene.rs` (tested) maps 1:1 to each `GpuSource.dest` rect.
- Honest diagnostics expose `previewTransport`, `previewImagePollCounts`,
  `previewSurfaceBacking`, `recordingProtected`, `encodeBackend`, `compositorBackend`,
  `compositorFallbackReason`, `compositorCpuFallbackFrames`, and the at-risk
  classification. The real-source OBS gate now fails while the shared compositor is on
  CPU fallback or the preview surface backing is still the Electron proof BrowserWindow.

## What remains (on-device only)

1. **Electron native view (Phase 2).** Embed the `CAMetalLayer` (driven by
   `present_texture_to_layer`) in a native `NSView` over the React preview rect, and stop
   the PNG polling on that path. This lives in Electron's AppKit main-thread runtime — it
   cannot be built or visually validated from the backend process or headlessly.
2. **GPU shader feature-completeness (Phase 3).** Finish any remaining scene-source edge
   cases so the GPU path covers every scene the CPU path does.
3. **Zero-copy + load validation.** `CVMetalTextureCache` import of camera/screen
   `CVPixelBuffer`s and an IOSurface export to `h264_videotoolbox`, validated against the
   p95 frame-time budget under real 1080p/1440p load, and the human OBS side-by-side.

## Phase 3 — replace the CPU compositor hot path

1. **Persist GPU objects per session.** Build `MTLDevice`, `MTLCommandQueue`, the render
   pipeline, and the sampler once at session start (today the test rebuilds per call).
   Cache source `MTLTexture`s per source id; `replaceRegion` on each new frame instead of
   reallocating.
2. **Import source frames as textures, ideally zero-copy.** Camera frames arrive as
   `CVPixelBuffer`; screen frames as IOSurface-backed `CVPixelBuffer` (ScreenCaptureKit).
   Use `CVMetalTextureCache` to wrap them as `MTLTexture` without a CPU copy, replacing
   the current BGRA `replaceRegion` upload for live sources.
3. **Render the scene** into a persistent target texture at the output cadence, driven by
   the existing compositor loop (`compositor.rs`), default-on on macOS with
   `VIDEORC_METAL_COMPOSITOR=0|false|off|no` as the CPU fallback escape hatch.
4. **Export to the encoder with the lowest copy available.** Allocate the target as an
   IOSurface-backed texture and feed that IOSurface/`CVPixelBuffer` to
   `h264_videotoolbox` (the bridge already uses VideoToolbox — Phase 4), avoiding the
   YUV420P CPU readback the FIFO bridge does today.
5. **Done gate:** 1080p30 and 1440p30 real screen+camera composition under the
   compositor frame-time budget (p95 < 16ms @ 60fps preview / < 30ms @ 30fps output);
   final recording shows no repeated frames from a late compositor.

## Phase 2 — native Metal preview layer (replace PNG polling)

1. **Present the compositor target to a `CAMetalLayer`.** The GPU-side primitive now
   render-scales the target texture into `nextDrawable().texture`, then calls
   `presentDrawable`; the remaining hard part is attaching that layer to a real window.
2. **Embed the layer in the Electron window.** Replace the current child `BrowserWindow`
   that HTML-polls `/preview/camera|screen/live.png` with a native `NSView` hosting the
   `CAMetalLayer`, positioned over the React preview rect (the renderer already reports
   the preview bounds via `preview-surface:update-bounds`). Options, simplest first:
   - a small N-API native addon that creates the `NSView`/`CAMetalLayer` and accepts the
     compositor's `IOSurface` id per frame; or
   - a Rust-side borderless child `NSWindow` overlay owned by the backend, positioned from
     the reported bounds (no Electron addon, mirrors today's overlay approach but native).
3. **Stop the PNG polling on the native path.** Once the layer shows real pixels, remove
   `startFramePolling`/`backendPreviewFrameUrl` for native mode and set
   `previewTransport = native-surface` and `previewSurfaceBacking = cametal-layer` only
   when the layer is actually presenting. The transport-honesty counters then read
   **0 image polls**, flipping the badge to **OBS-native** and passing the gate.
4. **Keep React for controls only** — handles, badges, overlays draw above the native
   layer.
5. **Done gate (human, on-device):** with native preview enabled, a 60s real
   screen+camera session performs **zero** primary `/preview/*` image polls
   (`previewImagePollCounts` flat); screen text is OBS-sharp; hand motion is current in an
   OBS side-by-side (`docs/obs-acceptance-checklist.md`).

## Validation boundary

Everything above compiles and the compositor core is unit-tested, but the two done-gates
are **visual** and **load-dependent**: they require running the app on the Mac, granting
capture permissions, and a human comparing preview sharpness/latency and recording
smoothness against OBS. That step is intentionally left to the operator — it is the same
"user-created videos are the evidence" bar the root-fix plan sets, and it is what the
automated honest gates were built to make trustworthy rather than replace.
