# Caption burn-in (A0–A4, B1–B3) — gate acceptance, 2026-07-02

Scope: the caption burn-in plan (Obsidian `2026-07-02 - Videorc Caption Burn-In Plan`,
grilled same day). All slices implemented and pushed; this note records what the
local gates PROVED versus what still needs a by-eye pass with a live session.

## Verified by gates (all green at commit `7715f8c5`)

- **Backend 693 tests / desktop 333 / web 198.**
- **Overlay slot (A1)**: PNG→RGBA decode with fail-closed limits; bad payloads
  keep the previous overlay; revisions increment; clear semantics.
- **Compositor blit (A2)**: synthetic-compositor tests prove the bar composites
  only on the leg carrying it (recording-leg frame byte-identical to baseline),
  correct straight-alpha math against a scene render, top placement + safe
  margin, wider-than-canvas center-crop.
- **Forced split (A4)**: same-profile record+stream yields no aux leg without
  burn-in and a same-resolution aux leg with it (unit test).
- **Rasterizer layout (A3)**: font scaling per width + S/M/L with a 24px floor,
  two-line greedy wrap keeping the tail, 92% width cap (6 vitest cases).
- **Chunk records (B1)**: epoch-anchor reset on frame-timestamp regression;
  web segments parse (camelCase); route returns word segments (web tests).
- **SRT (B2)**: segment-timed cues with absolute offsets, chunk-window
  fallback, overlap clamping, empty-chunk skipping (fixture tests).
- **ASS (B3)**: glass-adjacent style values (size/alignment/margin per knobs),
  brace/newline escaping, `(captioned)` path naming, ffmpeg filter-path
  escaping (unit tests).
- **Burn command shape**: validated against a synthesized clip **except** the
  ass filter itself — see the gap below.

## Environmental gap — RESOLVED 2026-07-02 (R-plan, commit `9af61c16`)

The libass gap is closed by option 2: the burn pivoted to a **PNG-overlay
track** (renderer renders full-frame cue PNGs → ffconcat playlist with exact
gap/cue durations → single CORE `overlay` filter pass, `-c:a copy`). The ASS
generator and preflight are deleted. **Proven end-to-end against the actual
bundled dependency-free ffmpeg** (`vendor/ffmpeg/current`): a synthesized clip
+ cue track produced `rec (captioned).mp4` with bar pixels present inside the
cue window (Y≈219 in the bar band) and absent outside (Y≈16). Also in the
R-plan (all on main): R0 — caption uploads never hard-stop (backoff + degraded
status carrying the real error; the "repeated upload failures" livestream bug
root-caused to the local web server being down); R1 — burn target
Off/Stream/Recording/Both with the per-leg plan matrix unit-tested.

## Post-R4 regression found & fixed (commit `4d2890a9`)

`burnTarget=recording` initially KILLED recordings (ffmpeg exit 187, ~1.5s
in): the overlay guard forced the CPU renderer, starving the VideoToolbox
encoder bridge which consumes Metal surfaces. Fixed by drawing the bar in the
Metal compositor as the topmost image source. Verified against the real
backend with a WS driver script: burnTarget=off and =recording both complete,
and the recorded pixels contain the bar (band luma 255 vs 168 control).

## Pending by-eye (needs a live premium session with a mic)

1. Stream leg shows the glass bar (~4s behind speech); native preview matches
   in stream-only sessions; recording-leg stays clean in record+stream.
2. `.srt` appears next to the recording with sane timings after stop.
3. Knobs (Top/Bottom, S/M/L) visibly apply.
4. Perf spot-check: forced-split extra render at 4K during burn-in.

Record the verdict here when run.
