description: Videorc's UI design language — a Raycast-style dark glass command-palette aesthetic, built exclusively from shadcn/ui components. Use whenever building, styling, reviewing, or planning ANY Videorc UI (new components, screens, dialogs, lists, toolbars), when the user mentions "our design", "the design skill", "Raycast style", or asks how something should look.

# Videorc Design Language

The single source of truth for how Videorc looks and feels. Every UI task follows this skill. The reference is a Raycast-style launcher: a floating, dark, translucent glass panel with crisp white typography, muted gray metadata, hairline structure, vivid rounded-square icons, and keyboard-first affordances.

**Status: target, not current state.** The existing UI does NOT follow this language yet. A dedicated migration plan will convert it screen by screen. Until a task explicitly executes that migration, do not restyle existing screens ad hoc — apply this skill fully to NEW surfaces, and to existing ones only when the task says so.

## Hard rules

1. **shadcn/ui only.** Every interface element is a shadcn/ui component (or a composition of them), installed and customized per the `shadcn` skill (`.agents/skills/shadcn/`, with reference docs in `~/.claude/skills/shadcn/`). No other component libraries, no hand-rolled widgets when a shadcn primitive exists. Tailwind utilities + shadcn CSS variables carry the theming.
2. **Dark glass first, light glass supported.** Dark is the default and the reference expression of this language. Light mode STAYS as a first-class twin: identical structure, patterns, spacing, and rules, with the light token column below — never a separately-designed theme. Both themes remain reachable via the existing theme toggle.
3. **Keyboard-first.** Every primary action has a visible shortcut, rendered as key chips (see Patterns). Footers advertise the current context's actions.
4. **Color is information.** The chrome is monochrome (blacks, grays, white). Saturated color appears ONLY in app/source icons and small status accents (e.g. live/connected green, destructive red). Never tint panels, rows, or text decoratively.

## Tokens

Express these as shadcn CSS variables (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--border`, `--radius`, …) in `globals.css`; values below are the design intent.

Surfaces (dark · light)
- Window/panel base, translucent over `backdrop-blur(60px) saturate(1.4)`: dark `rgba(24,24,27,0.75)` · light `rgba(245,245,247,0.75)`. Solid fallback where blur is unavailable (nested popovers at `0.92`): dark `#1C1C1F` · light `#F5F5F7`.
- Panels float: rounded corners `16–20px` (panel), layered shadow (`0 16px 70px rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` dark · `rgba(0,0,0,0.25)` light) + a tight `0 0 0 1px` hairline ring.
- Hairlines and borders: dark white-8% (`rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`) · light black-8% (`rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`); never solid gray borders.

Text (three tiers, nothing else; dark · light)
- Primary: `#F4F4F5` · `#1C1C1E`, weight 500 for titles/labels.
- Secondary: `#A1A1AA` · `#6E6E73`, weight 400 — inline context after a title, right-aligned metadata, placeholders.
- Tertiary: `#71717A` · `#98989D` — section headers, footer hints, disabled.

Selection & interaction (dark · light)
- Selected/hovered row: white-8% · black-6% overlay, radius `8–10px`, full-row block; no outlines, no color fills.
- Pressed: white-12% · black-10%. Focus-visible: 2px ring at 25% of the theme's hairline color (keyboard only).

Geometry & rhythm
- Radii: panel 16–20, rows/cards 8–10, key chips & small controls 6.
- Row height: 44–48px; list rows are single-line.
- Horizontal padding: 16–20px panel gutter; 12px between icon and title; 8px between title and inline context.
- Section headers get 16px top spacing, 8px bottom.

Type
- System font stack (SF Pro on macOS). Sizes: search/title input 18–20, row title 14–15, metadata/section headers 12–13, key chips 11–12.

Icons
- App/source icons: 24px rounded-square (radius ~6), vivid, full-color — they are the only large color on screen.
- Inline/status icons: 16px, Phosphor (already in the app), tinted secondary gray unless conveying status.

Motion
- Fast and subtle: 100–150ms ease-out. Panels fade+scale from 0.98; rows highlight instantly (no transition on selection). Nothing bounces.

## Core patterns

**Glass panel** — the universal container (windows, dialogs, palettes): translucent blurred charcoal, hairline ring, big radius, floating shadow. Content sits directly on it; no nested cards-on-cards.

**Search header** — borderless input on the panel itself: leading 24px icon, large placeholder in secondary gray, trailing hint (tertiary text + key chip). No input box outline; the panel IS the input surface. Use shadcn `Command` (cmdk) — this pattern is its native shape.

**Sectioned list** — tertiary-gray section label ("Development", "Suggestions"), then rows. Row anatomy, left to right:
1. 24px rounded-square icon
2. Primary title
3. Inline context in secondary gray on the same line (e.g. the owning app/platform)
4. Optional alias key chip (e.g. `st`)
5. Spring space
6. Right-aligned: optional small status icons, then the kind/metadata label in secondary gray ("Command", "Quicklink")

**Key chips (kbd)** — small rounded rect (radius 6), white 10% background, hairline border, secondary-gray glyph (`⌘`, `K`, `↵`, aliases). Build once as a `Kbd` composition of shadcn `Badge`/styled span and reuse everywhere.

**Footer action bar** — hairline-separated strip at panel bottom: leading app glyph button (ghost), trailing primary action label + its key chip, hairline vertical divider, secondary action ("Actions ⌘K"). All shadcn `Button variant="ghost"` + Kbd chips + `Separator`.

**Empty/hint states** — tertiary gray, centered, short; no illustrations.

## shadcn component mapping

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Palette / searchable list | `Command` (+ `CommandDialog`) |
| Modals & confirmations | `Dialog` themed as glass panel |
| Lists / destination rows | `Command` rows or composed row primitive (one shared component) |
| Buttons | `Button` ghost/outline; primary actions stay text+kbd, not big filled CTAs |
| Shortcut hints | `Kbd` composition (Badge-based), shared |
| Section/row dividers | `Separator` at white 8% |
| Badges/status | `Badge` with monochrome variants; color only for live/error |
| Scroll regions | `ScrollArea` |
| Menus/popovers | `DropdownMenu`/`Popover` on the solid-fallback surface |
| Toasts | sonner styled to the same glass tokens |

Missing a primitive? Install it via the shadcn CLI (see the shadcn skill) — do not hand-roll.

## Do / Don't

- DO keep chrome monochrome; let source icons and preview content provide the color.
- DO show shortcuts next to actions; the UI should read like a command surface.
- DO use one shared row component for every icon+title+meta list (destinations, sources, devices, recordings).
- DON'T use solid opaque cards, colored section backgrounds, or borders heavier than 1px white/8%.
- DON'T mix radii arbitrarily — panel/row/chip tiers only.
- DON'T introduce new fonts, icon sets, or component libraries.
- DON'T restyle existing screens outside the migration plan.
